*Next Set of Laws... ASP.NET MVC (Coming Soon)*

## 🤖 Advanced Vue.js *Requires* Communication, Experience and Wide & Deep Thinking 💪

### 🔟 Niles' **3 Laws** for Vue.js

1. **SSG-first!** Need More? Expand to SPA, **then** SSR. Don't be dictated by trends. Understand business needs and sensibly conclude an architecture.

2. Even if your use case does not warrant a build step....consider it! Utilizing **SFC** (Single-File Components) is imperative to abiding by `SOLID` principles and coding in Vue's philosophy.

3. _Composition API > Options API_. No Discussion needed. After **countless Vue 2 ➡️ Vue 3 migrations**, converting to the Composition API has been the single best benefit to developer productivity, code organization, and utilizing best software architecture principles.

## 🤖 Advanced Laravel *Isn't* For The Weak 💪

### 🔟 Niles' **10 Rules** for Laravel:

1. **Events-Driven Architecture** is awesome...until it isn't.

2. Embrace **Modules**, **Engines**, and other monolithic organization units

3. **Interfaces** are your friend. They provide clarity, extensibility, and make documentation easier.

4. Use the Service Container to your advantage. Think about how your classes, engines, and service classes will be used via the service container at the beginning.

5. Model Events are dangerous. I know it's controversial...but I've seen it fail too many times. If you do it, it should always be class based. It makes testing against it easier - architecture testing via Pest.

6. Utilize Model Permission Guards Extensively. Lock down database access based on roles and permissions.

7. TDD is King. I know it sucks, but you will be better off.

8. Be extremely wary of Livewire, it is tempting to transfer business logic to Livewire view classes.

9. Be extremely wary of Inertia.js. It makes life easy at the beginning. Some of its limitations cause problems later on.

10. Embrace the Manager Pattern, it's powerful...if you use it for good.
